						<h2>Outreach Ministries</h2>
						<p>We participate in various outreach opportunites throughout the year. And we invite you to join us as we reach out with the love of Christ to change our campus, community, and world. However, we have two outreach ministries that occur on a regular basis: John 3:16 and Drama which are discussed below.</p>
						<h3>John 3:16</h3>
						<p>"Then the righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?'"</p>
						<p>"The King will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.'"</p>
						<p style="text-align: right;">Matthew 25:37,40</p>
						<p>These verses explain the entire mindset for the John 3:16 ministry. Jesus said that we do Him a service when we feed the poor, and we ultimately want to serve Him to whatever extent we can.</p>
						<p>This ministry, while not a large time commitment, has a huge impact upon everyone involved. Not only do you get the chance to aid people who may be less fortunate; you put yourself in a position to let God change your heart and bless you through your giving. It is amazing what God can show you about life when you make yourself a servant, if even for just a short time.</p>
						<p>Chi Alpha participates in the John 3:16 Ministry on the first Monday of each month. We leave around 5:30 from ACAC and caravan down to the John 3:16 Mission. You can find out more from the <a href="http://www.john316mission.org/">John 3:16 Mission website</a>.</p>
						<h3>Drama</h3>
						<p>The Chi Alpha drama team sometimes gets a little crazy but that's the fun of it. What could be better than having a great time while spreading God's Word to others? That's what we set out to do with our long anticipated dance performance at the annual ACTS and skits that we prepare to perform throughout the year. Can't dance? Can't act? Hey, as long as you think it's fun we'd love to have you!</p>
